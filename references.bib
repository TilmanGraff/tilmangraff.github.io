Actual commuting responses were too weak in central locations in Daegu and {NYM}, and too strong across Seoul.},

After deﬁning the notion of an information-constrained wardrop equilibrium ({ICWE}) for this class of congestion games and studying its basic properties, we turn to our main focus: whether additional information can be harmful (in the sense of generating greater equilibrium costs/delays). We formulate this question in the form of an informational Braess’ paradox ({IBP}), which extends the classic Braess’ paradox in traﬃc equilibria and asks whether users receiving additional information can become worse oﬀ. We provide a comprehensive answer to this question showing that in any network in the series of linearly independent ({SLI}) class, which is a strict subset of series-parallel networks, the {IBP} cannot occur, and in any network that is not in the {SLI} class, there exists a conﬁguration of edge-speciﬁc cost functions for which the {IBP} will occur. In the process, we establish several properties of the {SLI} class of networks, which include the characterization of the complement of the {SLI} class in terms of embedding a speciﬁc set of networks, and also an algorithm that determines whether a graph is {SLI} in linear time. We further prove that the worst-case ineﬃciency performance of {ICWE} is no worse than the standard Wardrop equilibrium.},

This paper argues that market interactions between small ﬁrms substantially attenuate this concern, as they allow entrepreneurs to achieve scale collectively. We design a ﬁrm-level survey to measure production processes in three prominent manufacturing sectors in urban Uganda. We document that an active rental market for machines has emerged within clusters of small ﬁrms, and we build and estimate an equilibrium model of ﬁrm behavior to quantify its importance. Our results show that the rental market almost doubles the share of ﬁrms using machines, and increases labor productivity by 8\% relative to a counterfactual economy where renting is not possible. We show that the rental market leads to signiﬁcant gains in our context because it mitigates substantial imperfections in the labor, output, and ﬁnancial markets.},

Despite their relative poverty, developing world cities are relatively highly productive, and often provide good access to safe water, improved sanitation, schooling and inoculations. In some parts of the world, they are home to a surprisingly small number of factory workers and a surprisingly large number of farmers. Developing world cities seem to do less well at protecting their residents from lifestyle diseases and crime, their female residents from domestic violence and their children from illness. In thinking about these facts, we note that one strand of the literature focused on structural transformation has suggested that urbanization in the developing is occurring `too early’, while another strand argues that urbanization is occurring `too slow’ to be consistent with conventional models of spatial equilibrium. Despite many differences between developing and developed world cities, our new results combined with those in the literature suggest that models of spatial equilibrium can be adapted to be a useful guide to understanding the process of urbanization in the developing world.},

We find that areas receiving coverage from new towers and with no language barriers between farmers and advisers answering their calls experience higher adoption of high yielding varieties of seeds and other complementary inputs, as well as higher increase in agricultural productivity.

We show how nonlinearities associated with complementarities in consumption and production amplify the effect of negative supply and demand shocks. These nonlinearities are particularly potent when they are heterogeneous and affect the composition of demand as well as supply, features that are important for thinking about the Covid-19 crisis. We show how complementarities amplify the worst shocks, as the worst-affected sectors drag down other sectors. These complementarities are further strengthened if households change the composition of their demand in favor of the crippled sectors. A quantitative model suggests that nonlinearities may amplify the impact of the Covid-19 shock by between 20\% − 100\%, depending on the horizon of analysis and the size of the underlying shocks. This analysis implies that reductions in labor supply are less costly to aggregate output if they are spread out across many sectors.},

Transaction metadata also allows us to study variation in these reductions across geography, sectors, and mode of sale (e.g. online/oﬄine).

Here, we report primary humid tropical forest extent for the year 2001, and primary forest loss and distance to loss from 2002–2014 for the largest rainforest countries of Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo ({DRC}), and Indonesia. Brazil’s total area of primary forest loss is more than twice that of Indonesia and ﬁve times that of {DRC}. Despite unprecedented success in slowing deforestation along its forest frontier, Brazil’s most remote forests are increasingly nearer to loss, as extractive activities such as logging and mining intrude upon previously intact forests. In absolute terms, {DRC} has the lowest area of primary forest loss; however, its forests are increasingly encroached upon as smallholder agriculturalists move into remaining forests, often to escape conﬂict and insecurity. The decrease in {DRC} forests’ distance to loss as a function of area of forest loss was ﬁve times that of Brazil or Indonesia. In 2014, Indonesia had the least area of remaining primary forest. Despite an announced moratorium on concession licenses in 2011, Indonesia exhibited a rate of primary forest loss twice that of {DRC} and triple that of Brazil by the end of the study period. Forest loss dynamics in Indonesia range from industrial-scale clearing of coastal peatlands to logging of interior montane rainforests. While results illustrate considerable variation in forest loss dynamics between the three countries, the dominant narrative is of ongoing exploitation of primary humid tropical forests.},

I exploit the division of Germany, an exogenous change in borders, to test the ability of the model to predict highway development before and after the division. Using newly collected data, I document that the West German government considerably reshaped the highway network after the division shock. Reshaping the network after the division increased real income by 0.7\% to 2\%. However, this reshaping was constrained by the part of the network developed before division. Using the model, I quantify the cost of path-dependence from these pre-division highway links.

New ﬁrms raise wages and attract new workers, whose spending spurs the creation of more new ﬁrms. I estimate the model exploiting changes in local demand driven by aggregate structural change, and ﬁnd that this feedback is quantitatively powerful.

	abstract = {Unemployment rates diﬀer widely across local labor markets. I oﬀer new empirical evidence that high local unemployment emerges primarily because of elevated local job losing rates, even for observationally identical workers. I then propose a theory in which spatial diﬀerences in job loss arise endogenously. Highly productive employers prefer to ﬁll vacancies rapidly, as waiting implies foregoing high proﬁts. Therefore, they sort into high wage locations with few vacancies per job seeker while less productive employers sort into tight labor markets with low wages. Jobs at more productive employers are endogenously more stable, and spatial gaps in job losing rates arise. In contrast, the equilibrium response of reservation wages results in ﬂatter job ﬁnding rates across locations. Due to labor market frictions, productive employers over-value locating close to each other. Thus, the optimal policy incentivizes productive employers to relocate to areas with high job losing rates, providing a rationale for commonly used place-based policies. After structurally estimating the model on French administrative data, I show that it accounts for over 90\% of the cross-sectional dispersion in unemployment rates, as well as for the respective contributions of job losing and job ﬁnding rates. Employers’ ineﬃcient location choices amplify spatial unemployment diﬀerentials ﬁve-fold. Finally, I show that both real-world and optimal place-based policies yield sizable welfare gains at the local and aggregate level.},

Using insights from discrete geometry, we study a tractable limiting case of this problem in which these forces operate at a local level. Our results deliver clear predictions on sorting across space. Productive ﬁrms put relatively more establishments in dense locations that exhibit high rents, and their plants are larger than those of less productive ﬁrms in locations where both are present, after controlling for the number of plants. We present evidence consistent with these and several other predictions using U.S. establishment-level panel data.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the short- and long-run eﬀects of large ﬁrms on economic development. We use evidence from one of the largest multinationals of the 20th Century: The United Fruit Company ({UFCo}). The ﬁrm was given a large land concession in Costa Rica — one of the so-called “Banana Republics”— from 1889 to 1984. Using administrative census data with census-block geo-references from 1973 to 2011, we implement a geographic regression discontinuity ({RD}) design that exploits a quasi-random assignment of land. We ﬁnd that the ﬁrm had a positive and persistent eﬀect on living standards. Regions within the {UFCo} were 26\% less likely to be poor in 1973 than nearby counterfactual locations, with only 63\% of the gap closing over the following 3 decades. Company documents explain that a key concern at the time was to attract and maintain a sizable workforce, which induced the ﬁrm to invest heavily in local amenities that likely account for our result. We then build a dynamic spatial model in which a ﬁrm’s labor market power within a region depends on how mobile workers are across locations and run counterfactual exercises. The model is consistent with observable spatial frictions and the {RD} estimates, and shows that the ﬁrm increases aggregate welfare by 2.9\%. This eﬀect is increasing in worker mobility: If workers were half as mobile, the ﬁrm would have decreased aggregate welfare by 6\%. The model also shows that a local monopsonist compensates workers mostly through local amenities keeping wages low, and leads to higher welfare levels than a counterfactual with perfectly competitive labor markets in all regions, if we assume amenities increase local productivity.},

Ethnographic accounts suggest that in such societies, which are characterized by strong allegiances to distant relatives, individuals are obligated to come to the aid of fellow lineage members when they become involved in conﬂicts. As a consequence, small disagreements often escalate into larger-scale conﬂicts involving many individuals. We test for a link between segmentary lineage organization and conﬂict across ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a number of estimation strategies, including an {RD} design at ethnic boundaries, we ﬁnd that segmentary lineage societies experience more conﬂicts and particularly ones that are retaliatory, long in duration, and large in scale.},

We show that the partial equilibrium impact of trade shocks on regions takes the form of shift-share variables. In general equilibrium, regional shock exposure not only directly affects local outcomes, but also indirectly percolates to other regions. The sign and magnitude of these reduced-form indirect effects depend on observed data and assumptions about spatial links. Our theoretical characterization yields a methodology to efficiently estimate the direct and indirect effects of regional exposure to trade shocks, which can then be used to aggregate their impact in a modelconsistent way. We apply our methodology to study the impact of Chinese import competition on U.S. Commuting Zones. We find that indirect effects reinforce direct effects on both wages and employment. Typical literature calibrations of spatial links imply small direct effects and attenuating indirect effects that significantly weaken the model’s ability to fit employment and wage responses across regions.},

However, quantifying the welfare consequences of pricing policies requires detailed knowledge of commuter preferences and of the road technology. I study the peak-hour traﬃc congestion equilibrium using rich travel behavior data and a ﬁeld experiment grounded in theory. Using a newly developed smartphone app, I collected a panel data set with precise {GPS} coordinates for over 100,000 commuter trips in Bangalore, India. To identify the key preference parameters in my model – the value of time spent driving and schedule ﬂexibility – I designed and implemented a randomized experiment with two realistic congestion charge policies. The policies penalize peak-hour departure times and driving through a small charged area, respectively. Structural estimates based on the experiment show that commuters exhibit moderate schedule ﬂexibility and high value of time. In a separate analysis of the road technology, I ﬁnd a moderate and linear eﬀect of traﬃc volume on travel time. I combine the preference parameters and road technology using policy simulations of the equilibrium optimal congestion charge, which reveal notable travel time beneﬁts, yet negligible welfare gains. Intuitively, the social value of the travel time saved by removing commuters from the peak-hour is not signiﬁcantly larger than the costs to those commuters of traveling at diﬀerent, inconvenient times.},

What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difﬁcult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a design-based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design-based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling-based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual inﬁnite-population sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.},

	abstract = {Several scholars argue that high agricultural productivity can retard industrial development as it draws resources towards the comparative advantage sector, agriculture. However, agricultural productivity growth can increase savings and the supply of capital, generating an expansion of the capital-intensive sector, manufacturing. We highlight this mechanism in a simple model and test its predictions in the context of a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the adoption of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. We ﬁnd that agricultural productivity growth generated an increase in savings, but these were not reinvested locally. Instead, there were capital outﬂows from rural areas. Capital reallocated towards urban regions, where it was invested in the industrial and service sectors. The degree of ﬁnancial integration aﬀected the speed of structural transformation. Regions that were more ﬁnancially integrated with soy-producing areas through bank branch networks experienced faster growth in non-agricultural lending. Within these regions, ﬁrms with pre-existing relationships with banks receiving funds from the soy area experienced faster growth in borrowing and employment.},

            We develop an approach to measuring the cost of living for {CES} preferences that treats demand shocks as taste shocks that are equivalent to price shocks. In the presence of relative taste shocks, the Sato-Vartia price index is upward biased because an increase in the relative consumer taste for a variety lowers its taste-adjusted price and raises its expenditure share. By failing to allow for this association, the Sato-Vartia index underweights drops in taste-adjusted prices and overweights increases in taste-adjusted prices, leading to what we call a “taste-shock bias.” We show that this bias generalizes to other invertible demand systems.},

It had an unwritten constitution, separation of political powers, a judicial system with courts and juries, a police force, a military, taxation, and signiﬁcant public goods provision. Comparing individuals from the Kuba Kingdom to those from just outside the Kingdom, we ﬁnd that centralized formal institutions are associated with weaker norms of rule following and a greater propensity to cheat for material gain. This ﬁnding is consistent with recent models where endogenous investments to inculcate values in children decline when there is an increase in the effectiveness of formal institutions that enforce socially desirable behavior. Consistent with such a mechanism, we ﬁnd that Kuba parents believe it is less important to teach children values related to rule-following behaviors.},

We show that the macroeconomic impact of a shock can be boiled down into two components: its “pure” technology eﬀect; and its eﬀect on allocative eﬃciency arising from the reallocation of resources, which can be measured via changes in factor income shares. We derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions. As examples, we pursue some applications focusing on markup distortions. We operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative eﬃciency account for about 50\% of measured {TFP} growth over the period 1997-2015. We implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise {TFP} by about 20\%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1\% estimate by Harberger (1954).},

If instead rational inattention is modeled as a cost for observing prices or other endogenous outcomes, inefficiency can arise because of a cognitive externality: people do not internalize how their choices affect the complexity of the price system and thereby others’ cost of tracking or decoding it. This externality is muted in an important special case, when cognitive costs are given by the mutual information of agents’ decisions with the joint of the price system and the entire state of nature.

Since we estimate the response of prices to exchange rates to be far more muted, the recent depreciation of China’s renminbi is unlikely to alter this conclusion. Next, using product-level data from several large retailers, we demonstrate that the tariffs’ impact on retail prices is more mixed. Some affected product categories have seen sharp price increases, but the difference between affected and unaffected products is generally quite modest, suggesting that retail margins have fallen. These retailers' imports increased after the initial announcement of possible tariffs, but before their full implementation, so the intermediate passthrough of tariffs to their prices may not persist. Finally, in contrast to the case of foreign exporters facing {US} tariffs, we show that {US} exporters lowered their prices on goods subjected to foreign retaliatory tariffs compared to exports of non-targeted goods.},

Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},

By inverting such tests we can form one-sided conﬁdence intervals for the maximum (or minimum) eﬀect. These properties hold for all eﬀect-increasing test statistics, which include both common statistics such as the mean diﬀerence and uncommon ones such as Stephenson rank statistics. The latter’s sensitivity to extreme eﬀects permits detection of positive eﬀects even when the average eﬀect is negative. We argue that bounded nulls are often of substantive or theoretical interest, and illustrate with two applications: testing monotonicity in an {IV} analysis and inferring eﬀect sizes in a small randomized experiment.},

The model approximates the full class of factor demand systems consistent with Ricardian theory. In particular, our framework formalizes Ricardo’s insight that countries gain more from trade with partners that have relatively dissimilar technology. Incorporating this insight entails a simple correction to the sufficient-statistic approach used for macro counterfactuals, and enables a general aggregation result that links macro demand systems to micro estimates. In our quantitative application, we estimate a multi-sector trade model which captures the possibility that nearby countries may share technology, and, hence, have correlated productivity draws. Our estimates suggest that accounting for correlation is key to calculating the gains from trade.},

Accounting for nonlinear (non-Cobb- Douglas) production networks with realistic complementarities in production significantly raises the gains from trade relative to estimates in the literature. We use our general comparative statics results to show how models that abstract away from intermediates, no matter how well calibrated, are incapable of simultaneously predicting the costs of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Given trade volumes and elasticities, accounting for intermediates doubles the losses from tariffs. Better quantitative accuracy demands the use of more complicated, oftentimes computational, models.

We present instead a ‘dominant currency paradigm’ with three key features: pricing in a dominant currency, pricing complementarities, and imported input use in production. We test this paradigm using both a newly constructed data set of bilateral price and volume indices for more than 2,500 country pairs that covers 91\% of world trade, and very granular rm-product-country data for Colombian exports and imports. In strong support of the paradigm we nd that: (1) Non-commodities terms of trade are essentially uncorrelated with exchange rates. (2) e dollar exchange rate quantitatively dominates the bilateral exchange rate in price pass-through and trade elasticity regressions, and this e ect is increasing in the share of imports invoiced in dollars. (3) U.S. import volumes are signi cantly less sensitive to bilateral exchange rates, compared to other countries’ imports. (4) A 1\% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other currencies predicts a 0.6\% decline within a year in the volume of total trade between countries in the rest of the world, controlling for the global business cycle.},

The United States National Banking Act of 1864 was enacted when the circulating money supply primarily consisted of privately issued bank notes. The Act required “national banks” to fully back their bank note liabilities with federal bonds, thereby creating a new and stable currency, which reduced transactions costs and facilitated trade. National banks also faced regulatory capital requirements deﬁned by town population cutoﬀs. Using the discontinuity in the capital requirement as an instrument for national bank entry, we ﬁnd that the composition of agricultural production shifted from non-traded crops to traded crops while total production was unaﬀected. Moreover, trade activity proxied by employment in trade-related professions and businesses engaged in trade grew. National banks also led to signiﬁcant manufacturing output growth that was primarily driven by sourcing more inputs. Furthermore, the higher levels of manufacturing output persisted for two decades.},

Denmark used to impose one of the world’s highest marginal tax rates on wealth, but this tax was greatly reduced starting in 1989 and later abolished. Due to the speciﬁc design of the wealth tax, the 1989 reform provides a compelling quasi-experiment for understanding behavioral responses among the wealthiest segments of the population. We ﬁnd clear reduced-form effects of wealth taxes in the short and medium run, with larger effects on the very wealthy than on the moderately wealthy. We develop a simple lifecycle model with utility of residual wealth (bequests) allowing us to interpret the evidence in terms of structural primitives. We calibrate the model to the quasi-experimental moments and simulate the model forward to estimate the long-run effect of wealth taxes on wealth accumulation. Our simulations show that the long-run elasticity of wealth with respect to the net-of-tax return is sizeable at the top of distribution. Our paper provides the type of evidence needed to assess optimal capital taxation.},

Information acquisition, therefore, becomes an additional motive for trade. In this paper we use a combination of reduced-form techniques and structural analysis to characterize and measure experimentation motives for trade in the U.S. secondary market for municipal bonds. First, we provide reduced-form evidence that experimentation is a ﬁrst-order motive for trade. To rationalize these facts, we design a dynamic model of trade in this market that allows for linkages between trading activity and information acquisition (i.e., experimentation). The model is estimated using detailed micro-data on trading activity on the secondary market for municipal bonds. We use the model to characterize the incentives to experiment. We ﬁnd that dealers are willing to pay up to 15\% of the intermediation spread to double the precision of their information about the state of fundamentals. Furthermore, we show that experimentation allows dealers to increase the precision of their estimate of the asset’s value by 25\%, and we characterize the process of information diﬀusion across agents. Finally, we ﬁnd that experimentation explains up to 10\% of the volume of trade in the market.},

We validate our measure by showing that it correctly identiﬁes calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the ﬁrm’s actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean (as opposed to the variance) of political shocks. Interestingly, the vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the ﬁrm level rather than at the aggregate or sector level, in the sense that it is neither captured by the interaction of sector and time ﬁxed eﬀects, nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual ﬁrms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this ﬁrm-level political risk increases signiﬁcantly at times with high aggregate political risk. Decomposing our measure of political risk by topic, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms that devote more time to discussing risks associated with a given political topic tend to increase lobbying on that topic, but not on other topics, in the following quarter.},

Complementary data shows a corresponding rise in young college graduate expenditures on and trips to non-tradable services.

Consistent with a model of optimal within-ﬁrm resource allocation, we ﬁnd that establishment-level employment is sensitive to shocks in distant regions in which the parent ﬁrm is operating, and that the elasticity with respect to such shocks increases with ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial constraints. At the aggregate regional level, we ﬁnd that county-level employment is sensitive to shocks in distant counties linked through ﬁrms’ internal networks, suggesting that these networks matter for regional employment.},

	title = {China’s Overseas Lending},
	abstract = {Compared with China’s dominance in world trade, its expanding role in global finance is poorly documented and understood. Over the past decades, China has exported record amounts of capital to the rest of the world. Many of these financial flows are not reported to the {IMF}, the {BIS} or the World Bank. “Hidden debts” to China are especially significant for about three dozen developing countries, and distort the risk assessment in both policy surveillance and the market pricing of sovereign debt. We establish the size, destination, and characteristics of China’s overseas lending. We identify three key distinguishing features. First, almost all of China’s lending and investment abroad is official. As a result, the standard “push” and “pull” drivers of private cross-border flows do not play the same role in this case. Second, the documentation of China’s capital exports is (at best) opaque. China does not report on its official lending and there is no comprehensive standardized data on Chinese overseas debt stocks and flows. Third, the type of flows is tailored by recipient. Advanced and higher middle-income countries tend to receive portfolio debt flows, via sovereign bond purchases of the People’s Bank of China. Lower income developing economies mostly receive direct loans from China’s state-owned banks, often at market rates and backed by collateral such as oil. Our new dataset covers a total of 1,974 Chinese loans and 2,947 Chinese grants to 152 countries from 1949 to 2017. We find that about one half of China’s overseas loans to the developing world are “hidden”.},

We also document significant heterogeneity in the geographic breadth of social networks across New York zip codes, and show that much of this heterogeneity is explained by the ease of access to public transit, even after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics of the zip codes' residents. When we group zip codes with strong social ties into hypothetical communities using an agglomerative clustering algorithm, we find that geographically noncontiguous locations are grouped into socially connected communities, again highlighting that geographic distance is an imperfect proxy for urban social connectedness.

However, alongside unusually high t statistics, these regressions display severe spatial autocorrelation in residuals, and the purpose of this paper is to examine whether these two properties might be connected. We start by running artiﬁcial regressions where both variables are spatial noise and ﬁnd that, even for modest ranges of spatial correlation between points, t statistics become severely inﬂated leading to signiﬁcance levels that are in error by several orders of magnitude. We analyse 27 persistence studies in leading journals and ﬁnd that in most cases if we replace the main explanatory variable with spatial noise the ﬁt of the regression commonly improves; and if we replace the dependent variable with spatial noise, the persistence variable can still explain it at high signiﬁcance levels. We can predict in advance which persistence results might be the outcome of ﬁtting spatial noise from the degree of spatial autocorrelation in their residuals measured by a standard Moran statistic. Our ﬁndings suggest that the results of persistence studies, and of spatial regressions more generally, might be treated with some caution in the absence of reported Moran statistics and noise simulations.},

We present a model of demonetization where agents hold cash both to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint and for tax evasion purposes. We test the predictions of the model in the cross-section of Indian districts using several novel data sets including: the geographic distribution of demonetized and new notes for causal inference; nightlight activity and employment surveys to measure economic activity including in the informal sector; debit/credit cards and e-wallet transactions data; and banking data on deposit and credit growth. Districts experiencing more severe demonetization had relative reductions in economic activity, faster adoption of alternative payment technologies, and lower bank credit growth. The cross-sectional responses cumulate to a contraction in employment and nightlights-based output due to demonetization of 2 p.p. and of bank credit of 2 p.p. in 2016Q4 relative to their counterfactual paths, eﬀects which dissipate over the next few months. These cumulated eﬀects provide a lower bound for the aggregate eﬀects of demonetization. Our analysis rejects money non-neutrality using a large scale natural experiment, something that is yet rare in the vast literature on the eﬀects of monetary policy.},

Drawing on a complementary theoretical literature, the paper discusses conditions under which the cross-sectional multiplier provides a rough lower bound for a particular national multiplier, the closed economy, no-monetary-policy-response ﬁscal spending multiplier. Putting these elements together, the cross-sectional evidence suggests a national no-monetary-policyresponse multiplier of about 1.7 or above.

We use a randomized controlled trial to empirically evaluate how information and communication technologies ({ICT}) can mitigate moral hazard and enable ﬁrms to design more eﬃcient contracts which increase proﬁts and engender business growth. Speciﬁcally, we study a ﬂeet of 255 minibuses (matatus) in Nairobi, Kenya, where we introduce monitoring devices that track real-time vehicle location, daily productivity, and safety statistics. We randomize whether minibus owners have access to these monitoring data using a novel mobile app. This information allows owners in the treatment group to observe a more precise signal of driver eﬀort, the amount of revenue drivers collected in fares, and the extent to which the driver engages in reckless driving. We ﬁnd that treated vehicle owners modify the terms of the contract by decreasing the rental price they demand. Drivers respond by working more hours, decreasing behavior that damages the vehicle, and under-reporting revenue by less. These changes improve ﬁrm proﬁts and reduce management costs, thereby helping treated ﬁrms grow. The device also improves owners’ trust in their drivers, which drivers say makes their job easier. Finally, we investigate whether these gains to the company come at the expense of passenger safety, in an environment where accidents are common. While we do not ﬁnd any evidence that conditions deteriorate, oﬀering detailed information on driving behavior also does not improve safety. Only by incentivizing drivers through an additional cash treatment do we detect safety improvements.},

	abstract = {In 2016 the city of Bogotá doubled police patrols and intensiﬁed city services on high-crime streets. They did so based on a policy and criminological consensus that such place-based programs not only decrease crime, but also have positive spillovers to nearby streets. To test this, we worked with Bogotá to experiment on an unprecedented scale. They randomly assigned 1,919 streets to either 8 months of doubled police patrols, greater municipal services, both, or neither. Such scale brings econometric challenges. Spatial spillovers in dense networks introduce bias and complicate variance estimation through “fuzzy clustering.” But a design-based approach and randomization inference produce valid hypothesis tests in such settings. In contrast to the consensus, we ﬁnd intensifying state presence in Bogotá had modest but imprecise direct eﬀects and that such crime displaced nearby, especially property crimes. Conﬁdence intervals suggest we can rule out total reductions in crime of more than 2–3\% from the two policies. More promising, however, is suggestive evidence that more state presence led to an 5\% fall in homicides and rape citywide. One interpretation is that state presence may more easily deter crimes of passion than calculation, and place-based interventions could be targeted against these incredibly costly and violent crimes.},

Second, most growth seems to occur through improvements of existing varieties rather than creation of brand new varieties.

We study how the rise in China’s trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector and state. We ﬁnd that the China trade shock resulted in a reduction of about 0.55 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 16\% of the observed decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the aggregate, but due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets.

We discuss a range of explanations for nearly-uniform pricing, highlighting managerial inertia and brand-image concerns as mechanisms frequently mentioned by industry participants. Relative to our optimal benchmark, uniform pricing may signiﬁcantly increase the prices paid by poorer households relative to the rich, dampen the response of prices to local economic shocks, alter the analysis of mergers in antitrust, and shift the incidence of intra-national trade costs.},

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials ({RCTs}) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in {RCTs} over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment eﬀect ({ATE}), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more diﬃcult than commonly believed. At best, an {RCT} yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justiﬁcation is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an {RCT} while undervaluing its potential contribution. {RCTs} do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientiﬁc progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. {RCTs} can play a role in building scientiﬁc knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

	abstract = {In the past few decades multistore retailers, especially those with 100 or more stores, have experienced substantial growth. At the same time, there is widely reported public outcry over the impact of these chain stores on other retailers and local communities. This paper develops an empirical model to assess the impact of chain stores on other discount retailers and to quantify the size of the scale economies within a chain. The model has two key features. First, it allows for ﬂexible competition patterns among all players. Second, for chains, it incorporates the scale economies that arise from operating multiple stores in nearby regions. In doing so, the model relaxes the commonly used assumption that entry in different markets is independent. The lattice theory is exploited to solve this complicated entry game among chains and other discount retailers in a large number of markets. It is found that the negative impact of Kmart’s presence on Wal-Mart’s proﬁt was much stronger in 1988 than in 1997, while the opposite is true for the effect of Wal-Mart’s presence on Kmart’s proﬁt. Having a chain store in a market makes roughly 50\% of the discount stores unproﬁtable. Wal-Mart’s expansion from the late 1980s to the late 1990s explains about 40–50\% of the net change in the number of small discount stores and 30–40\% for all other discount stores. Scale economies were important for Wal-Mart, but less so for Kmart, and the magnitude did not grow proportionately with the chains’ sizes.},

This holds true even restricting the analysis to the subsample of the most powerful ministerial posts.

While the literature has emphasized long-run negative economic impacts via institutional quality, the changes in economic organization implemented to spur production historically could also directly inﬂuence economic organization in the long-run, exerting countervailing eﬀects. We examine these in the context of the Dutch Cultivation System, the integrated industrial and agricultural system for producing sugar that formed the core of the Dutch colonial enterprise in 19th century Java. We show that areas close to where the Dutch established sugar factories in the mid-19th century are today more industrialized, have better infrastructure, are more educated, and are richer than nearby counterfactual locations that would have been similarly suitable for colonial sugar factories. We also show, using a spatial regression discontinuity design on the catchment areas around each factory, that villages forced to grow sugar cane have more village owned land and also have more schools and substantially higher education levels, both historically and today. The results suggest that the economic structures implemented by colonizers to facilitate production can continue to promote economic activity in the long run, and we discuss the contexts where such eﬀects are most likely to be important.},

	title = {Changes in Social Network Structure in Response to Exposure to Formal Credit Markets},
	abstract = {We study how the introduction of microﬁnance changes the networks of interactions among 16476 households in 75 Indian villages, and develop a new dynamic model of network formation to explain the empirical ﬁndings. None of the villages were exposed to microﬁnance by 2006, and 43 villages were through 2010. Using a two-wave panel of network data collected in 2006 and 2012, we compare changes in networks in villages exposed to microﬁnance relative to those not exposed. Networks exposed to microﬁnance experience a signiﬁcantly greater loss of links—for credit relationships as well as advice and other types of relationships—compared to those not exposed. Microﬁnance not only results in decreases in relationships among those likely to get loans, but also decreases in relationships between those unlikely to get loans. These patterns are inconsistent with models of network formation in which people have opportunities to connect with whomever they wish, but are consistent with a model that emphasizes chance meetings that depend on relative eﬀorts to socialize coupled with conditional choices of whom to connect with, as well as externalities in payoﬀs across relationships between pairs and triples of people.},

	title = {When Less is More: Experimental Evidence on Information Delivery during India's Demonitization},
	abstract = {How should policymakers disseminate information: by broadcasting it widely (e.g., via mass media), or letting word spread from a small number of initially informed “seed” individuals? While conventional wisdom suggests delivering information more widely is better, we show theoretically and experimentally that this may not hold when people need to ask questions to fully comprehend the information they were given. In a ﬁeld experiment during the chaotic 2016 Indian demonetization, we varied how information about demonetization’s oﬃcial rules was delivered to villages on two dimensions: how many were initially informed (broadcasting versus seeding) and whether the identity of the initially informed was publicly disclosed (common knowledge). The quality of information aggregation is measured in three ways: the volume of conversations about demonetization, the level of knowledge about demonetization rules, and choice quality in a strongly incentivized decision dependent on understanding the rules. Our results are consistent with four predictions of a model in which people need others’ help to make the best use of announced information, but worry about signaling inability or unwillingness to correctly process the information they have access to. First, if who is informed is not publicized, broadcasting improves all three outcomes relative to seeding. Second, under seeding, publicizing who is informed improves all three outcomes. Third, when broadcasting, publicizing who is informed hurts along all three dimensions. Finally, when who is informed is made public, telling more individuals (broadcasting relative to seeding) is worse along all three dimensions.},

In contrast to most models of social learning in a network, the target being learned about is moving around. We ask: when can a group aggregate information quickly, keeping up with the changing state? First, if each agent has access to neighbors with suﬃciently diverse kinds of signals, then Bayesian learning achieves good information aggregation. Second, without such diversity, there are cases in which Bayesian information aggregation necessarily falls far short of eﬃcient benchmarks. Third, good aggregation requires agents who understand correlations in neighbors’ actions with the sophistication needed to concentrate on recent developments and ﬁlter out older, outdated information. In stationary equilibrium, agents’ learning rules incorporate past information by taking linear combinations of other agents’ past estimates (as in the simple {DeGroot} heuristic), and we characterize the coeﬃcients in these linear combinations.},

	abstract = {We provide a nonlinear characterization of the macroeconomic impact of microeconomic productivity shocks in terms of reduced-form non-parametric elasticities for eﬃcient economies. We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced-form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the ﬁrst order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by ﬁrst-order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business-cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fat-tailed (excess kurtosis), and a has negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thintailed. Average output losses due to short-run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic eﬀects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long-run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol’s cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low-growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate {TFP} growth over the period 1948-2014 in the {US}.},

Using a novel municipal-level dataset on revolutionary insurgency, the study documents that municipalities experiencing severe drought just prior to the Revolution were substantially more likely to have insurgent activity than municipalities where drought was less severe. Many insurgents demanded land reform, and following the Revolution, Mexico redistributed over half of its surface area in the form of ejidos: farms comprised of individual and communal plots that were granted to a group of petitioners. Rights to ejido plots were non-transferable, renting plots was prohibited, and many decisions about the use of ejido lands had to be countersigned by politicians. Instrumental variables estimates show that municipalities with revolutionary insurgency had 22 percentage points more of their surface area redistributed as ejidos. Today, insurgent municipalities are 20 percentage points more agricultural and 6 percentage points less industrial. Incomes in insurgent municipalities are lower and alternations between political parties for the mayorship have been substantially less common. Overall, the results support a view of history in which relatively modest events can have highly nonlinear and persistent inﬂuences, depending on the broader societal circumstances.},

Rich historical data document that in Dai Viet villages, citizens have been better able to organize for public goods and redistribution through civil society and local government.

We ﬁnd that a village in the 90th percentile of the travel-cost adjusted price distribution faces input and output prices 40-55\% less favorable than a village at the 10th percentile. In reduced form, an additional standard deviation of travel time is associated with 20-25\% lower input adoption and output sales. We develop and quantify a spatial model of input adoption and conservatively estimate that farmers behave as if they face local travel costs of 5.7\% ad-valorem per kilometer of travel, which is equivalent to 45\% when traveling to the closest retailer. Holding exogenous local factors ﬁxed, we estimate that reducing travel costs by 50\% (approximately the eﬀect of paving rural roads) would double adoption and reduces the adoption-remoteness gradient by 15\%.},

	abstract = {The mechanism(s) that generate measurement error matter to inference. Survey measurement error is typically thought to represent simple misreporting correctable through improved measurement. But errors might also or alternatively reﬂect respondent misperceptions that materially aﬀect the respondent decisions under study. We show analytically that these alternate data generating processes imply diﬀerent appropriate regression speciﬁcations and have distinct eﬀects on the bias in parameter estimates. We introduce a simple empirical technique to generate unbiased estimates under more general conditions and to apportion measurement error between misreporting and misperceptions in measurement error when one has both self-reported and objectively-measured observations of the same explanatory variable. We then apply these techniques to the longstanding question of agricultural intensiﬁcation: do farmers increase input application rates per unit area as the size of the plots they cultivate decreases? Using nationally representative data from four sub-Saharan African countries, we ﬁnd strong evidence that measurement error in plot size reﬂects a mixture of farmer misreporting and misperceptions. The results matter to inference around the intensiﬁcation hypothesis and call into question whether more objective, precise measures are always preferable when estimating behavioral parameters.},

	abstract = {Raising smallholder agricultural productivity has the potential to boost {GDP} and to reduce rural poverty, but the evidence on how to best achieve productivity gains remains mixed. Technologies exist that can increase smallholder yields and proﬁts, but researchers and practitioners grapple with how to induce technology adoption in this population. This task is particularly challenging and pressing in sub-Saharan Africa, where agricultural yields lag all other regions and where poverty is often concentrated in rural areas. This paper presents randomized evidence of a rare scaled-up success story: One Acre Fund’s (1AF) small farmer program. Much like anti-poverty “graduation” programs, 1AF’s program is designed around the notion that farmers face multiple constraints simultaneously. Participating farmers receive input loans, crop insurance, and training about improved farming practices. Analyzing data from a pre-registered randomized control trial, we show that participation in 1AF’s program causes statistically and economically signiﬁcant increases in yields and proﬁts. We ﬁnd evidence that relaxing information constraints alone unlikely explains the program’s success. Using various approaches to heterogeneity analysis, we ﬁnd suggestive evidence that more disadvantaged farmers beneﬁt more from the program and that program impacts increase over time. Both results are in line with the literature on graduation programs, which typically target the most disadvantaged, provide them with a bundle of diﬀerent types of support, and continue to work with them as they climb out of poverty.},

The experiment tracks 1700 workers and 1500 …rms over four years to contrast the e¤ects of o¤ering workers vocational training ({VT}) to o¤ering …rms wage subsidies to train workers on-the-job ({FT}). Both treatments lead to skill accumulation but whilst {VT} workers learn sector-speci…c skills, {FT} workers learn more …rm-speci…c skills. This is associated with higher employment rates for each type of worker but the e¤ect is 50\% larger for {VT} (21\% vs 14\%) and their total earnings increase by more (34\% vs 20\%). Structurally estimating a job ladder model reveals the mechanisms: {VT} workers receive higher rates of unemployment-to-job o¤ers and higher rates of job-to-job o¤ers. This greater labor market mobility stems from the certi…ability and transferability of their skills, and causes the wage pro…les of {VT} workers to diverge away from {FT} workers. Evidence from the …rm-side of the experiment complements these …ndings: we …nd that some of the higher returns to {VT} are driven by workers matching to higher productivity …rms. Our evidence shows both …rms and workers are constrained in this setting and that subsidies to either side of the labor market would increase workers’ employment and earnings. However, {VT} workers are better o¤ than {FT} workers as the greater certi…ability and transferability of their skills allows them to climb the job ladder more quickly. {JEL} Classi…cation: J2, M5.},

	shorttitle = {Competition and Relational Contracts},
	abstract = {Business transactions often occur in the absence of enforceable contracts. To sustain trade in such cases, parties rely on relational contracts ({RC}). Introducing competition might change exit options, thus undermining the ability to sustain {RC}. To examine the impact of competition in procurement of inputs, we exploit the prevalence of {RC} between processing mills and farmers in Rwanda’s coﬀee sector. We implement a census of all mills and farmers to capture the features of the {RC} binding them. We then develop a {RC} model to capture the incentive problems between mills and farmers. The model is used to predict how competition aﬀects {RC}, the mill’s performance, and farmer outcomes. Since the location of mills is endogenous, an engineering model is estimated for the optimal placement of mills to instrument for competition in each locality. We ﬁnd that competition between mills undermines {RC} by increasing the mill’s processing costs, lowering the mill’s capacity utilization and reducing the quality of coﬀee cherries received by the mill. Competition constraints the farmer’s credit and input choices and reduces farmer’s wellbeing. The ﬁndings highlight that in weak contracting settings, the value {RC} generates can be hampered by competition. The evidence provides a rationale for policies commonly observed historically across developing countries, such as zoning regulations and monopsony licensing, and emphasizes the importance of promoting contractual enforcement in agricultural value chains in order to reap the beneﬁts of competition.},

In a ﬁeld experiment in Kenya, we show that credit market imperfections limit farmers’ abilities to move grain inter-temporally. Providing timely access to credit allows farmers to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices, increasing farm revenues and generating a return on investment of 29\%. To understand general equilibrium eﬀects of these changes in behavior, we vary the density of loan oﬀers across locations. We document signiﬁcant eﬀects of the credit intervention on seasonal price ﬂuctuations in local grain markets, and show that these {GE} eﬀects shape individual level proﬁtability estimates. In contrast to existing experimental work, the results indicate a setting in which microcredit can improve ﬁrm proﬁtability, and suggest that {GE} eﬀects can substantially shape microcredit’s eﬀectiveness.

One unattractive aspect of this model is the assumption that the process starts with every node in the network having a signal. We study a natural extension of the {DeGroot} model that can deal with sparse initial signals. We show that an agent’s social inﬂuence in this generalized {DeGroot} model is essentially proportional to the number of uninformed nodes who will hear about an event for the ﬁrst time via this agent. This characterization result then allows us to relate network geometry to information aggregation. We identify an example of a network structure where essentially only the signal of a single agent is aggregated, which helps us pinpoint a condition on the network structure necessary for almost full aggregation. We then simulate the modeled learning process on a set of real world networks; for these networks there is on average 21.6\% information loss. We also explore how correlation in the location of seeds can exacerbate aggregation failure. Simulations with real world network data show that with clustered seeding, information loss climbs to 35\%.},

To measure the importance of indirect effects we propose a class of consistent estimators for the model’s aggregate elasticities based on cross-market variation in exposure to observed foreign cost shocks. The “optimal” estimator in this class uses the local responses to the trade shock predicted by our general equilibrium model – the Model-implied Optimal {IV} ({MOIV}). Applying our methodology to {US} {CommutingZones}, we find a limited role for indirect effects in the response to trade shocks, implying that the model’s general equilibrium predictions are well approximated by difference-in-difference designs based on simple measures of local shock exposure.},

Finally, we use these estimates to compute the impact of a trade war between {US} and China.},

This behavior has traditionally been modeled via unit roots or fractional Brownian motion and explained via aggregation of heterogeneous processes, nonlinearity, learning dynamics, regime switching, or structural breaks. This paper identiﬁes a different and complementary mechanism for long-memory generation by showing that it can naturally arise when a large number of simple linear homogeneous economic subsystems with short memory are interconnected to form a network such that the outputs of the subsystems are fed into the inputs of others. This networking picture yields a type of aggregation that is not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is richer than that of individual subsystems. Interestingly, the long-memory behavior is found to be almost entirely determined by the geometry of the network, while being relatively insensitive to the speciﬁc behavior of individual agents.},

Based on a sample of 318 cities across 28 countries using satellite data on built cover over time, Anglophone origin cities sprawl compared to Francophone ones. Anglophone cities have less intense land use and more irregular layout in the older colonial portions of cities, and more leapfrog development at the extensive margin. Results are impervious to a border experiment, many robustness tests, measures of sprawl, and sub-samples. Why would colonial origins matter? The British operated under indirect rule and a dual mandate within cities, allowing colonial and native sections to develop without an overall plan and coordination. In contrast, integrated city planning and land allocation mechanisms were a feature of French colonial rule, which was inclined to direct rule. The results also have public policy relevance. From the Demographic and Health Survey, similar households which are located in areas of the city with more leapfrog development have poorer connections to piped water, electricity, and landlines, presumably because of higher costs of providing infrastructure with urban sprawl.},

Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions.

When economic conditions are poor, some ﬁrms might decide not to operate, thereby severing the links with their neighbors and changing the shape of the production network. In the model, producers beneﬁt from having access to additional suppliers, and so nearby ﬁrms tend to operate, or not, together. As a result, the production network features clusters of operating ﬁrms, and the exit of a producer can create a cascade of ﬁrm shutdowns. While well-connected ﬁrms are better able to withstand shocks, they trigger larger cascades upon exit. The theory also predicts how the structure of the production network changes over the business cycle. As in the data, recessions are associated with more dispersed networks that feature fewer highly connected ﬁrms. In the calibrated economy, the endogenous reorganization of the network substantially dampens the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on aggregate ﬂuctuations.},

            Many developing economies adopt industrial policies favoring selected sectors. Is there an economic logic to this type of intervention? I analyze industrial policy when economic sectors form a production network via input-output linkages. Market imperfections generate distortionary effects that compound through backward demand linkages, causing upstream sectors to become the sink for imperfections and have the greatest size distortions. My key finding is that the distortion in sectoral size is a sufficient statistic for the social value of promoting that sector; thus, there is an incentive for a well-meaning government to subsidize upstream sectors. Furthermore, sectoral interventions’ aggregate effects can be simply summarized, to first order, by the cross-sector covariance between my sufficient statistic and subsidy spending. My sufficient statistic predicts sectoral policies in South Korea in the 1970s and modern-day China, suggesting that sectoral interventions might have generated positive aggregate effects in these economies.},

Subsidies were randomly assigned at the household level to identify the direct eﬀect of price, and subsidy saturation was randomly varied at the community level to identify strategic complementarities in demand. We conduct counter-factual simulations to analyze the policymaker’s tradeoﬀs along price, saturation and scope margins: To raise aggregate latrine adoption, is it better to intensely subsidize a few, or widely disperse subsidies across households or communities? We also analyze the eﬀects of targeting subsidies on the basis of household poverty, social position, or neighborhood population density. Finally, we use additional experiments to explore mechanisms underlying the complementarity in demand, and ﬁnd that shame and changing social norms are driving factors.},

We characterize analytically the conditions for efficiency, show how they translate into efficient pricing rules, as well as derive the optimal taxes for the case where the planner is not able to set prices. We use our theoretical results to explore welfare loss and optimal policy in dry bulk shipping. We find that the constrained efficient allocation achieves 6\% welfare gains, while the first-best allocation corresponding to the frictionless world, achieves 14\% welfare gains. This suggests that policy can achieve substantial gains, even if it does not alleviate search frictions, e.g. through a centralizing platform.

	abstract = {In this paper we study the welfare effects of encouraging rural-urban migration in the developing world. To do so, we build a dynamic incomplete-markets model of migration that allows for sorting on permanent comparative advantage, idiosyncratic productivity shocks and migration risk, plus migration disutility that depends on past migration experience. We estimate the model to replicate the results of a ﬁeld experiment that subsidized migration in rural Bangladesh, leading to signiﬁcant increases in seasonal migration rates and consumption for induced migrants. To match the experimental evidence, the model requires that migration subsidies are more likely to induce migration from those with relatively low productivity and asset levels, and that the non-monetary disutility of migrating is substantial. We conclude that the welfare effects of migration subsidies arise through better insurance for vulnerable rural households rather than by relaxing credit constraints for those with high urban productivity but who are stuck in rural areas.},

I offer a simple explanation for this: beneﬁts and costs of technologies are heterogeneous, so that farmers with low net returns do not adopt the technology. I examine this hypothesis by estimating a correlated random coefﬁcient model of yields and the corresponding distribution of returns to hybrid maize. This distribution indicates that the group of farmers with the highest estimated gross returns does not use hybrid, but their returns are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technology (due to poor infrastructure). Another group of farmers has lower returns and adopts, while the marginal farmers have zero returns and switch in and out of use over the sample period. Overall, adoption decisions appear to be rational and well explained by (observed and unobserved) variation in heterogeneous net beneﬁts to the technology.},

	abstract = {Migration and pollution are two of the deﬁning features of China’s impressive growth performance over the last 30 years. In this paper we study the migration response to the dispersion of pollution across Chinese cities, and its consequences for productivity and welfare. We document a robust pattern in which college-educated workers emigrate more in response to pollution than the unskilled. Their greater sensitivity to air quality holds up in cross-sectional variation across cities, panel variation with individual and city ﬁxed-eﬀects, and when instrumenting for pollution using distant power-plants upwind of cities, or thermal inversions that trap pollution. Pollution therefore changes the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers, which results in higher returns to skill in cities that the educated migrate away from. We quantify the loss in aggregate productivity due to this sorting by estimating a model of demand and supply of skilled and unskilled workers across Chinese cities. Reducing pollution increases {GDP} both by directly improving health and productivity, and indirectly by changing the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers. Counterfactual simulations show that gains through the indirect spatial sorting channel are larger than the direct health beneﬁts of clean air. Hukou migrationpolicy restrictions on mobility exacerbates the losses in productivity and welfare.},

I compare the effects of a recent highway project that improved the connections between Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and Mumbai to a counterfactual Indian highway network that mimics the Chinese strategy of connecting intermediate-sized cities. The counterfactual network among these cities is designed to approximately maximize net income based on the general equilibrium framework and road construction costs. I use satellite data on night lights to estimate the model at the level of Indian districts. The results suggest that the actual network led to large aggregate gains but unequal effects across regions. The income-maximizing counterfactual network is substantially larger than the actual Indian network, would imply further aggregate gains, and would beneﬁt the lagging regions of India.},

            We study optimal spatial policies in a quantitative trade and geography framework with spillovers and spatial sorting of heterogeneous workers. We characterize the spatial transfers that must hold in efficient allocations, as well as labor subsidies that can implement them. There exists scope for welfare-enhancing spatial policies even when spillovers are common across locations. Using data on U.S. cities and existing estimates of the spillover elasticities, we find that the U.S. economy would benefit from a reallocation of workers to currently low-wage cities. The optimal allocation features a greater share of high-skill workers in smaller cities relative to the observed allocation. Inefficient sorting may lead to substantial welfare costs.},

How does this imperfect and heterogeneous information structure aﬀect the spatial allocation of economic activity and welfare? To address this question, I develop a quantitative dynamic model of migration with costly information acquisition and local information sharing. Rationally inattentive agents optimally acquire more information about nearby locations and learn about payoﬀs in other locations from the migrants around them. I apply this model to internal migration in Brazil and estimate it using migration ﬂows between regions. To illustrate its quantitative implications, I evaluate the counterfactual eﬀects of the roll-out of broadband internet in Brazil. By allowing workers to make better mobility choices, expanding internet access increases average welfare by 1.6\%, reduces migration ﬂows by 1.2\% and reduces the cross-sectional dispersion in earnings by 4\%.},

Inertia looms large as differences in the literacy of the old generation explain about half of the observed spatial disparities in {IM}. The rural-urban divide is substantial. Though conspicuous in some countries, there is no evidence of systematic gender gaps in {IM}. Second, we characterize the geography of {IM}, ﬁnding that colonial investments in railroads and Christian missions, as well as proximity to capitals and the coastline are the strongest correlates. Third, we ask whether the regional differences in mobility reﬂect spatial sorting or their independent role. To isolate the two, we focus on children whose families moved when they were young. Comparing siblings, looking at moves triggered by displacement shocks, and using historical migrations to predict moving-families’ destinations, we establish that, while selection is considerable, regional exposure effects are at play. An extra year spent in a high-mobility region before the age of 12 (and after 5) signiﬁcantly raises the likelihood for children of uneducated parents to complete primary school. Overall, the evidence suggests that geographic and historical factors laid the seeds for spatial disparities in {IM} that are cemented by sorting and the independent impact of regions.},

This paper demonstrates that such reliance increases wage inequality but leads to greater production in developing countries.

By exploiting heterogeneous exposure, I show that the program led ﬁrms to replace technology licensed from developed countries with in-house innovations, which led to a decline in both employment and the share of high-skilled workers. I explain these ﬁndings using a model of directed technological change and cross-country technology transactions. Firms in a developing country can either innovate or lease technology from a developed country, and these two technologies diﬀer endogenously regarding productivity and skill bias due to factor supply disparities in the two countries. I show that the diﬀerence in skill bias and productivity can be identiﬁed using closed-form solutions by the eﬀect of the innovation program on ﬁrms’ expenditure share with low-skilled workers and employment. By calibrating the model to reproduce these eﬀects, I ﬁnd that increasing the share of ﬁrms that patent in Brazil by 1 p.p. decreases the skilled wage premium by 0.02\% and production by 0.2\%.},

Starting from the colonial period, which has been linked to almost all of Africa’s postindependence maladies, we first review works that uncover the lasting legacies of colonial investments in infrastructure and human capital and quantify the role of various extractive institutions, such as indirect rule and oppression associated with concessionary agreements. Second, we discuss the long-lasting impact of the “Scramble for Africa,” which led to ethnic partitioning and the creation of artificial modern states. Third, we cover studies on the multifaceted legacy of the slave trades. Fourth, we analyze the contemporary role of various precolonial, ethnic-specific, institutional, and social traits such as political centralization. We conclude by offering some thoughts on what we view as open questions. ( {JEL} F54, N17, N37, N47, O10, O43)},

	abstract = {The question of the minimum menu-size for approximate (i.e., up-to-ε) Bayesian revenue maximization when selling two goods to an additive risk-neutral quasilinear buyer was introduced by Hart and Nisan (2013), who give an upper bound of O(1/ε4) for this problem. Using the optimal-transport duality framework of Daskalakis et al. (2013, 2015), we derive the ﬁrst lower bound for this problem — of Ω(1/√4 ε), even when the values for the two goods are drawn i.i.d. from “nice” distributions, establishing how to reason about approximately optimal mechanisms via this duality framework. This bound implies, for any ﬁxed number of goods, a tight bound of Θ(log 1/ε) on the minimum deterministic communication complexity guaranteed to suﬃce for running some approximately revenue-maximizing mechanism, thereby completely resolving this problem. As a secondary result, we show that under standard economic assumptions on distributions, the above upper bound of Hart and Nisan (2013) can be strengthened to O(1/ε2).},

This work isolates a causality channel by exploiting the fact that the introduction of the steamship in the shipping industry produced an asymmetric change in trade distances among countries. Before this invention, trade routes depended on wind patterns. The steamship reduced shipping costs and time in a disproportionate manner across countries and trade routes. Using this source of variation and novel data on shipping, trade, and development, I find that (i) the adoption of the steamship had a major impact on patterns of trade worldwide; (ii) only a small number of countries, characterized by more inclusive institutions, benefited from trade integration; and (iii) globalization was the major driver of the economic divergence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850–1900.

Our approach yields analytical expressions for transportation costs between any two locations, the trafﬁc along each link of the transportation network, and the equilibrium distribution of economic activity across the economy, each as a function of the underlying quality of infrastructure and the strength of traﬃc congestion. We characterize the properties of such an equilibrium and show how the framework can be combined with traﬃc data to evaluate the impact of improving any segment of the infrastructure network. Applying our framework to both the U.S. highway network and the Seattle road network, we ﬁnd highly variable returns to investment across diﬀerent links in the respective transportation networks, highlighting the importance of well-targeted infrastructure investment.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the minimum cost transshipment problems have been simpliﬁed as linear cost problems, which are not practical in real applications. Recently, some advanced local search algorithms have been developed that can directly solve concave cost bipartite network problems. However, they are not applicable to general transshipment problems. Moreover, the eﬀectiveness of these modiﬁed local search algorithms for solving general concave cost transshipment problems is doubtful. In this research, we propose a global search algorithm for solving concave cost transshipment problems. Eﬃcient methods for encoding, generating initial populations, selection, crossover and mutation are proposed, according to the problem characteristics. To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed global search algorithm, four advanced local search algorithms based on the threshold accepting algorithm, the great deluge algorithm, and the tabu search algorithm, are also developed and are used for comparison purpose. To assist with the comparison of the proposed algorithms, a randomized network generator is designed to produce test problems. All the tests are performed on a personal computer. The results indicate that the proposed global search algorithm is more eﬀective than the four advanced local algorithms, for solving concave cost transshipment problems.},

	shorttitle = {All Aboard},
	abstract = {This paper examines the effects of port development on the economy. By using scarce local land intensively, ports put pressure on local land prices and crowd out other forms of economic activity. We use the introduction of containerized shipping -- a technology that substantially increased land requirements at the port -- to estimate the effects of port development. We find an important role for the crowding-out effect both at the local and at the aggregate level. First, we show that the causal effect of the shipping boom caused by containerization on local population is zero -- port development increases city population by making a location more attractive for firms and consumers, but this well-known market access effect is fully offset by the crowding-out mechanism. Second, to measure the aggregate implications, we add endogenous port development to a standard quantitative model of cross-city trade. Through the lens of this model, we estimate that containerization increased aggregate world welfare by 3.95\%. However, relative to the positive welfare effects of a trade-cost reduction in standard models, our model implies a sizeable welfare cost associated with the increased land-usage of ports, partly offset by welfare gains from endogenous specialization based on comparative advantage across port- and non-port activities. In terms of the distributional effects, we find that initially poorer countries gained more from containerization as they had a comparative advantage in port development.},

Documentation for the kingdom of Kongo during the 1500s to 1800 allows us to explore how the trade was sustained and the social and political dynamics behind it. In a state that consistently exported large numbers of slaves throughout the period of the trade, kings of Kongo at ﬁrst observed quite a pronounced distinction between foreign-born captives subject to enslavement and sale in the Atlantic trade and freeborn Kongos who were largely proctected from enslavement and sale overseas. In time, however, the distinctions that separated foreign-born and Kongos fell apart as later political authorities and others disregarded such distinctions and all Kongos became subject to enslavement and sale overseas. This was a product of internal Kongo conﬂicts, which witnessed the collapse of institutions and the redeﬁnition of polity, what it meant to be a citizen or freeborn, and who could be enslaved.},

	abstract = {Fisher’s randomization test (frt) delivers exact p-values under the strong null hypothesis of no treatment eﬀect on any units whatsoever and allows for ﬂexible covariate adjustment to improve the power. Of interest is whether the procedure could also be valid for testing the weak null hypothesis of zero average treatment eﬀect. Towards this end, we evaluate two general strategies for frt with covariate-adjusted test statistics: that based on the residuals from an outcome model with only the covariates, and that based on the output from an outcome model with both the treatment and the covariates. Based on theory and simulation, we recommend using the ordinary least squares (ols) ﬁt of the observed outcome on the treatment, centered covariates, and their interactions for covariate adjustment, and conducting frt with the robust tvalue of the treatment as the test statistic. The resulting frt is ﬁnite-sample exact for the strong null hypothesis, asymptotically valid for the weak null hypothesis, and more powerful than the unadjusted analog under alternatives, all irrespective of whether the linear model is correctly speciﬁed or not. We develop the theory for complete randomization, cluster randomization, stratiﬁed randomization, and rerandomization, respectively, and give a recommendation for the test procedure and test statistic under each design. We ﬁrst focus on the ﬁnite-population perspective and then extend the result to the super-population perspective, highlighting the diﬀerence in standard errors. Motivated by the similarity in procedure, we also evaluate the design-based properties of ﬁve existing permutation tests originally for linear models and show the superiority of the proposed frt for testing the treatment eﬀects.},

A separate literature highlights the links between exponential growth and Pareto distributions: Gabaix (1999) shows how exponential growth generates Pareto distributions, while Kortum (1997) shows how Pareto distributions generate exponential growth. But this raises a “chicken and egg” problem: which came ﬁrst, the exponential growth or the Pareto distribution? And regardless, what happened to the Romer and Weitzman insight that combinatorics should be important? This paper answers these questions by demonstrating that combinatorial growth in the number of draws from standard thin-tailed distributions leads to exponential economic growth; no Pareto assumption is required. More generally, it provides a theorem linking the behavior of the max extreme value to the number of draws and the shape of the tail for any continuous probability distribution.},

            We document two changes in post-war {US} macroeconomic dynamics: the procyclicality of labour productivity vanished, and the relative volatility of employment rose. We propose an explanation for these changes that is based on reduced hiring frictions due to improvements in information about the quality of job matches and the resulting decline in turnover. We develop a simple model with hiring frictions and variable effort to illustrate the mechanisms underlying our explanation. We show that our model qualitatively and quantitatively matches the observed changes in business cycle dynamics.},

	abstract = {The Real Business Cycle ({RBC}) research program has grown spectacularly over the last decade, as its concepts and methods have diffused into mainstream macroeconomics. Yet, there is increasing skepticism that technology shocks are a major source of business fluctuations. This chapter exposits the basic {RBC} model and shows that it requires large technology shocks to produce realistic business cycles. While Solow residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise of real business cycles. However, we show that greater factor variation also dramatically amplifies shocks: a {RBC} model with varying capital utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative changes in technology.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes that idiosyncratic ﬁrm-level shocks can explain an important part of aggregate movements and provide a microfoundation for aggregate shocks. Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual ﬁrm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of ﬁrm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 ﬁrms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This “granular” hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clariﬁed by looking at the behavior of large ﬁrms. This paper’s ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the ﬂuctuations of other economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance.},
