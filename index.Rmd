I am a PhD student in Economics at [Harvard](https://economics.harvard.edu).

Prior to grad school, I spent two years in Nairobi as a research specialist at the [Busara Center](https://www.busaracenter.org). I hold an MPhil. in Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk), a Bsc. in Economics from [LMU Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and a Bsc. in Management and Technology from [TU Munich](https://www.wi.tum.de). 

I am interested in the effects of space on economic networks, development, and trade. I want to understand how human geography and history shape the spatial distribution of economic activity, how small-scale regional exchange aggregates into global trade systems, and why Nairobi's traffic gets so much worse in rainy season.

I love coding (mostly in R) and visualising patterns in large datasets. Other things I am enthusiastic about include investigative journalism, modern art, and mediocre rowing.

My CV can be found [here](files/CV Graff.pdf), my research is listed [here](research.html).
