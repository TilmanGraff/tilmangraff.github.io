I am a PhD student in Economics at Harvard.

Prior to grad school, I spent two years in Nairobi as a research specialist at the Busara Center. I hold an MPhil. in Economics at the University of Oxford, a Bsc. in Economics from LMU Munich, and a Bsc. in Management and Technology from TU Munich.

I am interested in the effects of space on economic networks, development, and trade. I want to understand how human geography and history shape the spatial distribution of economic activity, how microeconomic exchange aggregates into global trade systems, and why Nairobiâ€™s traffic gets so much worse in rainy season.

I love coding (mostly in Julia and R) and visualising patterns in large datasets. Other things I am enthusiastic about include investigative journalism, modern art, and mediocre rowing.
