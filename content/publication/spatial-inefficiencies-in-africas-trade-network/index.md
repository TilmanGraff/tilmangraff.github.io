abstract: I assess the efficiency of transport networks for every country in
  Africa. Using rich spatial data, I simulate trade flows over more than 70,000
  links covering the entire continent. I maximise over the space of networks and
  find the optimal road system for every African state. My simulations predict
  that Africa would gain 1.1% of total welfare from better organising its
  national road systems. I then construct a novel dataset of local network
  inefficiency and I find that colonial infrastructure projects significantly
  skew trade networks towards a sub-optimal equilibrium. I also find evidence
  for regional favouritism and inefficient aid provision.
